	abstract = {Android's permission system is intended to inform users about the risks of installing applications. When a user installs an application, he or she has the opportunity to review the application's permission requests and cancel the installation if the permissions are excessive or objectionable. We examine whether the Android permission system is effective at warning users. In particular, we evaluate whether Android users pay attention to, understand, and act on permission information during installation. We performed two usability studies: an Internet survey of 308 Android users, and a laboratory study wherein we interviewed and observed 25 Android users. Study participants displayed low attention and comprehension rates: both the Internet survey and laboratory study found that 17\% of participants paid attention to permissions during installation, and only 3\% of Internet survey respondents could correctly answer all three permission comprehension questions. This indicates that current Android permission warnings do not help most users make correct security decisions. However, a notable minority of users demonstrated both awareness of permission warnings and reasonable rates of comprehension. We present recommendations for improving user attention and comprehension, as well as identify open challenges.},

	abstract = {The Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) paradigm is becoming extremely popular across all kind of organizations. In fact, employees are continually trying to incorporate their personal devices, e.g. smartphones and tablets, into the office to perform some of their work or simply to access the Internet with a device they trust or they are more familiar with. Unfortunately, several security issues may arise from all these external devices accessing the corporate network. To address these issues, in this paper we propose a framework that enforces on-the-fly instantiated policies inside organizations using trusted BYOD technologies. The proposed framework implements a role-based access control system based upon user identity and her current context. To this end, each user receives a specific policy from a server based upon the current role and context. The effective user identity is confirmed using OAuth 2.0, while the device integrity and policy enforcement is ensured by means of a on-device root-of-trust and an enforcer running on each device.},

	doi = {10.1109/SECPRI.1998.674819},
	abstract = {We describe an architecture for secure, independent, interworking services (Oasis). Each service is made responsible for the classification of its clients into named roles, using a formal logic to specify precise conditions for entering each role. A client becomes authenticated by presenting credentials to a service that enable the service to prove that the client conforms to its policy for entry to a particular role. During authentication a data structure is created that embodies the proof. An authenticated client is issued a role membership certificate (RMC) for its subsequent use with that service. An RMC is an encryption-protected capability which includes the role name, the identity of the principal to which it was issued and a reference to the issuing service. A proof rule of one service may refer to an authenticated user of another; that is, an RMC issued by one service may be required as a credential during authentication by another. A dynamic proof tree may thus be built which exhibits amongst other things the trust relationships between the services which the client has entered. The paper shows how a service may define a set of proof rules (Horn clauses) that specify who may use it and in what way. Delegation of rights may be expressed naturally within these rules. It goes on to present the design details of the system. The system is inherently decentralised and has a tuneable reaction to network or server failure which allows services to make appropriate decisions when authorization or revocation information is unavailable. A prototype system has been implemented and tested},

Key concepts of the language include roles to group policies relating to a position in an organisation, relationships to define interactions between roles and management structures to define a configuration of roles and relationships pertaining to an organisational unit such as a department. These reusable composite policy specifications cater for the complexity of large enterprise information systems. Ponder is declarative, strongly-typed and object-oriented which makes the language flexible, extensible and adaptable to a wide range of management requirements.},

We define the class of linearly decomposable unary constraint domains, prove that Datalog extended with constraints in any combination of such constraint domains is tractable, and show that permissions associated with structured resources fall into this class. We also present a concrete declarative TM language, RT C 1 , based on constraint Datalog, and use constraint Datalog to analyze another TM system, KeyNote, which turns out to be less expressive than RT C 1 in significant respects, yet less tractable in the worst case. Although constraint Datalog has been studied in the context of constraint databases, TM applications involve different kinds of constraint domains and have different computational complexity requirements.},

A collateral phenomenon is called BYOD (Bring Your Own Device), that means the employees use their own devices also during their working time. These changing of habits represent an opportunity and a challenge for the enterprises. The opportunity is related to two main aspects: the productivity increase and the costs reduction. In a BYOD scenario the end users would pay totally or partially the devices and would work independently from time and location. On the opposite side, the new scenario bring some risks that could be critical. The use of devices for both personal and working activities opens to new security threats to face for IT organization. Also, the direct comparison between public cloud services for personal use and company's IT services could be a frustrating user experience, that's because of the public cloud services are often almost more effective and usable than typical IT company's services. The aim of this work is presenting a brief survey about the emerging methods and models to approach the BYOD phenomenon from the security point of view.},

Access requests are mapped to logical authorization queries, consisting of predicates and constraints combined by conjunctions, disjunctions, and negations. Access is granted if the query succeeds against the current database of clauses. Predicates ascribe rights to particular principals, with flexible support for delegation and revocation. At the discretion of the delegator, delegated rights can be further delegated, either to a fixed depth, or arbitrarily deeply. Our language strikes a careful balance between syntactic and semantic simplicity, policy expressiveness, and execution efficiency. The syntax is close to natural language, and the semantics consists of just three deduction rules. The language can express many common policy idioms using constraints, controlled delegation, recursive predicates, and negated queries. We describe an execution strategy based on translation to Datalog with Constraints, and table-based resolution. We show that this execution strategy is sound, complete, and always terminates, despite recursion and negation, as long as simple syntactic conditions are met.},

	abstract = {Conventional access control are suitable for regulating access to resources by known users.However,these models have often found to be inadequate for open and decentralized multi-centric systems where the user population is dynamic and the identity of all users are not known in advance.For such systems, credential based access control has been proposed. Credential based systems achieve access control by implementing a binary notion of trust.If a user is trusted by virtue of successful evaluation of its credentials it is allowed access, otherwise not. However,such credential based models have also been found to be lacking because of certain inherent drawbacks with the notion of credentials.In this work,we propose a trust based access control model called TrustBAC. It extends the conventional role based access control model with the notion of trust levels.Users are assigned to trust levels instead of roles based on a number of factors like user credentials,user behavior history,user recommendation etc. Trust levels are assigned to roles which are assigned to permissions as in role based access control.The TrustBAC model thus incorporates the advantages of both the role based access control model and credential based access control models.},

	abstract = {Users of Android phones increasingly entrust personal information to third-party apps. However, recent studies reveal that many apps, even benign ones, could leak sensitive information without user awareness or consent. Previous solutions either require to modify the Android framework thus significantly impairing their practical deployment, or could be easily defeated by malicious apps using a native library. In this paper, we propose AppCage, a system that thoroughly confines the run-time behavior of third-party Android apps without requiring framework modifications or root privilege. AppCage leverages two complimentary user-level sandboxes to interpose and regulate an app's access to sensitive APIs. Specifically, dex sandbox hooks into the app's Dalvik virtual machine instance and redirects each sensitive framework API to a proxy which strictly enforces the user-defined policies, and native sandbox leverages software fault isolation to prevent the app's native libraries from directly accessing the protected APIs or subverting the dex sandbox. We have implemented a prototype of AppCage. Our evaluation shows that AppCage can successfully detect and block attempts to leak private information by third-party apps, and the performance overhead caused by AppCage is negligible for apps without native libraries and minor for apps with them.},

The increased number of applications results in a greater chance of installing Trojans and similar malware. In this paper, we propose the Kirin security service for Android, which performs lightweight certification of applications to mitigate malware at install time. Kirin certification uses security rules, which are templates designed to conservatively match undesirable properties in security configuration bundled with applications. We use a variant of security requirements engineering techniques to perform an in-depth security analysis of Android to produce a set of rules that match malware characteristics. In a sample of 311 of the most popular applications downloaded from the official Android Market, Kirin and our rules found 5 applications that implement dangerous functionality and therefore should be installed with extreme caution. Upon close inspection, another five applications asserted dangerous rights, but were within the scope of reasonable functional needs. These results indicate that security configuration bundled with Android applications provides practical means of detecting malware.},

Users must judge apps by the information shown to them by the store. Studies have found that most users do not pay attention to an apps permissions during installation [19] and most users do not understand how permissions relate to the capabilities of an app [30]. To address these problems and more, we present AppPAL: a machine-readable policy language for Android that describes precisely when apps are acceptable. AppPAL goes beyond existing policy enforcement tools, like Kirin [16], adding delegation relationships to allow a variety of authorities to contribute to a decision. AppPAL also acts as a “glue”, allowing connection to a variety of local constraint checkers (e.g., static analysis tools, packager manager checks) to combine their results. As well as introducing AppPAL and some examples, we apply it to explore whether users follow certain intended policies in practice, finding privacy preferences and actual behaviour are not always aligned in the absence of a rigorous enforcement mechanism.},

We then consider axiomatizing these logics. In general, it can be shown that no complete axiomatization is possible. We provide axiom systems that are sound and complete in cases where a complete axiomatization is possible, showing that they do allow us to capture a great deal of interesting reasoning about probability.},

This paper seeks to better understand the potential security threats posed by benign Android apps that use the SSL/TLS protocols to protect data they transmit. Since the lack of visual security indicators for SSL/TLS usage and the inadequate use of SSL/TLS can be exploited to launch Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks, an analysis of 13,500 popular free apps downloaded from Google's Play Market is presented.  We introduce MalloDroid, a tool to detect potential vulnerability against MITM attacks. Our analysis revealed that 1,074 (8.0\%) of the apps examined contain SSL/TLS code that is potentially vulnerable to MITM attacks. Various forms of SSL/TLS misuse were discovered during a further manual audit of 100 selected apps that allowed us to successfully launch MITM attacks against 41 apps and gather a large variety of sensitive data. Furthermore, an online survey was conducted to evaluate users' perceptions of certificate warnings and HTTPS visual security indicators in Android's browser, showing that half of the 754 participating users were not able to correctly judge whether their browser session was protected by SSL/TLS or not. We conclude by considering the implications of these findings and discuss several countermeasures with which these problems could be alleviated.},

Second, we designed new attribution mechanisms; a qualitative experiment suggested that our proposed mechanisms are intuitive to understand. Finally, we performed a laboratory experiment in which we simulated application misbehaviors to observe whether users equipped with our attribution mechanisms were able to identify the offending applications. Our results show that, for users who notice application misbehaviors, these attribution mechanisms are significantly more effective than the status quo.},

The measures are additive probabilities (used in the Bayesian theory), coherent lower (or upper) previsions, belief functions (used in the Dempster-Shafer theory) and possibility measures (fuzzy logic). Special emphasis is given to the theory of coherent lower previsions, in which upper and lower probabilities, expectations and conditional probabilities are constructed from initial assessments through a technique of natural extension. Mathematically, all the measures can be regarded as types of coherent lower or upper previsions, and this perspective gives some insight into the properties of belief functions and possibility measures. The measures are evaluated according to six criteria: clarity of interpretation; ability to model partial information and imprecise assessments, especially judgements expressed in natural language; rules for combining and updating uncertainty, and their justification; consistency of models and inferences; feasibility of assessment; and feasibility of computations. Each of the four measures seems to be useful in special kinds of problems, but only lower and upper previsions appear to be sufficiently general to model the most common types of uncertainty.},

To inform our analysis, we collect a dataset of Android application metadata and extract features from these binaries to gain a better understanding of how developers interact with the security mechanisms invoked during installation. Using the dataset, we find empirical evidence that Android's current signing architecture does not encourage best security practices. We also find that limitations of Android's UID sharing method force developers to write custom code rather than rely on OS-level mechanisms for secure data transfer between apps. As a result of our analysis, we recommend incrementally deployable improvements, including a novel UID sharing mechanism with applicability to signature-level permissions. We additionally discuss mitigation options for a security bug in Google's Play store, which allows apps to transparently obtain more privileges than those requested in the manifest.},

	abstract = {Enabling the shared care paradigm, centralised or even decentralised electronic health record (EHR) systems increasingly become core applications in hospital information systems and health networks. For realising multipurpose use and reuse as well as inter-operability at knowledge level, EHR have to meet special architectural requirements. The component-oriented and model-based architecture should meet international standards. Especially in extended health networks realising inter-organisational communication and co-operation, authorisation cannot be organised at user level anymore. Therefore, models, methods and tools must be established to allow formal and structured policy definition, policy agreements, role definition, authorisation and access control.

Based on the author’s international engagement in EHR architecture and security standards referring to the revision of CEN ENV 13606, the GEHR/open EHR approach, HL7 and CORBA, models for health-specific and EHR-related roles, for authorisation management and access control have been developed. The basic concept is the separation of structural roles defining organisational entity-to-entity relationships and enabling specific acts on the one hand, and functional roles bound to specific activities and realising rights and duties on the other hand. Aggregation of organisational, functional, informational and technological components follows specific rules. Using UML and XML, the principles as well as some examples for analysis, design, implementation and maintenance of policy and authorisation management as well as access control have been practically implemented.},

Most distributed access control architectures have far more rigid policy rules, yet in many respects aim to solve a similar problem. This paper elucidates the similarities between trust management and distributed access control systems by demonstrating how the OASIS access control system and its rôle-based policy language can be extended to make decisions on the basis of trust and risk analyses rather than on the basis of credentials alone. We apply our new model to the prototypical example of a file storage and publication service for the Grid, and test it using our Prolog-based OASIS implementation.},

	abstract = {Policies are rules that govern the choices in behaviour of a system. Security policies define what actions are permitted or not permitted, for what or for whom, and under what conditions. Management policies define what actions need to be carried out when specific events occur within a system or what resources must be allocated under specific conditions. There is considerable interest in the use of policies for the security and management of large-scale networks and distributed services. Existing policy work has focussed on specification, information models and application-specific policy enforcement. We address the important goal of providing a general-purpose deployment model for policies that is independent of the underlying policy enforcement mechanisms and can be employed in mixed policy environments. In this paper, we present a deployment model that is object-oriented and addresses the instantiation, distribution and enabling of policies as well as the disabling, unloading and deletion of policies. The model defines objects for policies, for domains, and for the policy enforcement agent and outlines the interactions needed between them. The model also caters for changes in the memberships of domains since such changes also effect policy enforcement. The model forms part of the run-time support for Ponder; a new policy language that combines structuring ideas from object-oriented languages with a common set of policy basic types},

The study aims at investigating (a) what advancement of content knowledge students made in their science inquiry in a seamless learning environment supported by their own mobile device; (b) how the students advanced their content knowledge in science inquiry; and (c) what students' perception is regarding their learning experience supported by their own mobile devices. The topic of inquiry was “The Anatomy of Fish”. Data collection included pre- and post-domain tests, self-reported questionnaire, student artifacts, class observations and field notes. Content analysis and a student artifact tracing approach were adopted in the data analysis to examine and trace students' knowledge advancement. The research findings show that the students advanced their understanding of the anatomy of fish well beyond what was available in the textbook and they developed positive attitude toward seamless science inquiry supported by their own mobile devices.},

To achieve this, smart spaces need to capture situational information so that they can detect changes in context and adapt themselves accordingly. However, without considering basic security issues ubiquitous computing environments could be rife with vulnerabilities. Ubiquitous computing environments impose new requirements on security. Security services, like authentication and access control, have to be non-intrusive, intelligent, and able to adapt to the rapidly changing contexts of the spaces. We present a ubiquitous security mechanism that integrates context-awareness with automated reasoning to perform authentication and access control in ubiquitous computing environments.},

However, this access control model is too coarse grained for the BYOD scenario, because employees would like to have a finer control on the rights granted to such applications, for instance to protect their privacy when they are not on duty. To address this issue, we propose to enhance the Android permission system through a Usage Control-based framework enabling employees to write policies which are continuously enforced while BYOD applications are running. This framework acts as a dynamic permission manager, where usage control policies grants, revokes and restores permissions to running applications on the base of mutable attributes describing the current context. Context is observed by using Android device standard APIs to monitor attributes such as mobile device location, WiFi status, battery level, current date and time, and so on. External trusted attribute providers can also be exploited.},

None of the participating hospitals had a dedicated information governance policy for bring your own device. Data were collected by 17 investigators for 392 individual theatre lists, capturing 14 148 individual data points, 12 852 (91\%) of which were transmitted to a central database on the day of collection without any loss of data. BYOD technology enabled accurate collection of a large volume of secure data across multiple NHS organisations over a short period of time.

As a matter of fact, today smartphones and tablets have remarkable hardware profiles and a cornucopia of applications. Yet, the security mechanisms offered by most popular mobile operating systems offer only limited protection to the threats posed by malicious applications that may be inadvertently installed by the users and therefore they do not meet the security standards required in corporate environments. In this paper we propose a security framework for mobile devices that ensures that only applications complying with the organization security policy can be installed. This is done by inferring behavioral models from applications and by validating them against the security policy.

A client app sends intermittent, coarse-grained measurements to a server, which correlates higher expected energy use with client properties like the running apps, device model, and operating system. The analysis quantifies the error and confidence associated with a diagnosis, suggests actions the user could take to improve battery life, and projects the amount of improvement. During a deployment to a community of more than 500,000 devices, Carat diagnosed thousands of energy anomalies in the wild. Carat detected all synthetically injected anomalies, produced no known instances of false positives, projected the battery impact of anomalies with 95\% accuracy, and, on average, increased a user's battery life by 11\% after 10 days (compared with 1.9\% for the control group).},

The only previous independent estimate (0.0009\%) [11], was based on indirect measurements obtained from domain-name resolution traces. In this paper, we present the first independent study of malware infection rates and associated risk factors using data collected directly from over 55,000 Android devices. We find that the malware infection rates in Android devices estimated using two malware datasets (0.28\% and 0.26\%), though small, are significantly higher than the previous independent estimate. Based on the hypothesis that some application stores have a greater density of malicious applications and that advertising within applications and cross-promotional deals may act as infection vectors, we investigate whether the set of applications used on a device can serve as an indicator for infection of that device. Our analysis indicates that, while not an accurate indicator of infection by itself, the application set does serve as an inexpensive method for identifying the pool of devices on which more expensive monitoring and analysis mechanisms should be deployed. Using our two malware datasets we show that this indicator performs up to about five times better at identifying infected devices than the baseline of random checks. Such indicators can be used, for example, in the search for new or previously undetected malware. It is therefore a technique that can complement standard malware scanning. Our analysis also demonstrates a marginally significant difference in battery use between infected and clean devices.},

The authors identified thirteen studies that demonstrated the ability of personal digital assistants (PDAs) to positively impact on areas of rapid response, error prevention, and data management and accessibility. The use of PDAs demonstrates the greatest benefits in contexts where time is a critical factor and a rapid response crucial. However, the extent to which these devices improved outcomes and workflow efficiencies because of their mobility was largely absent from the literature. The paucity of evidence calls for much needed future research that asks explicit questions about the impact the mobility of devices has on work practices and outcomes.},

	abstract = {Introduction
Hospitals are increasingly looking for mobile solutions to meet their information technology needs. Medical professionals are using personal mobile devices to support their work, because of limitations in both time and space. Our aims were to assess smartphone use amongst UK surgical doctors, the prevalence of medical app use and online activity.
Methods
A thirteen-item questionnaire was derived to identify the proportion of surgical doctors of all grades using smartphones within the workplace. The following factors were evaluated: use of medical apps; use of online medical resources and if users were willing to use their own smartphone for clinical use.
Results
A total of 341 participants were surveyed with a complete response rate: 93.5\% of which owned a smartphone, with 54.2\% of those owning medical apps and 86.2\% using their device to access online medical resources.

Junior doctors were more likely to use medical apps over their senior colleagues (p = 0.001) as well as access the Internet on their smartphone for medical information (p \&lt; 0.001).

Overall, 79.3\% stated that they would be willing to use their smartphone for clinical use, which was found not to be dependent on seniority (p = 0.922).
Conclusion
Online resources contribute significantly to clinical activities with the majority of smartphone users willing to use their own device. The information gathered from this study can aid developers to create software dedicated to the smartphone operating systems in greatest use and to potentially increase the use of a bring your own device (BYOD) scheme.},

	abstract = {As computing technology becomes more pervasive and broadband services are
deployed into residential communities, new applications will emerge for the
home and community environment. These applications will assist people in a
variety of daily activities by enabling them to create, access, and
manipulate information about the residents and resources in their homes. In
a connected community, resources in the home and information about the
residents of the home will be remotely accessible to both residents and
guests, as well as to potentially malicious users. These new applications,
as well as their users and environment, pose new security challenges. The
challenges stem from two factors: the nature of the home itself---a private
space with a wealth of personal and sensitive information---and the limited
technical knowledge and capabilities of the home's residents.

We are addressing the problem of securing applications that will access and
control information resources in the home of the future. Specifically, we
are designing a security system based on a paradigm called Generalized
Role-Based Access Control (GRBAC). GRBAC is an extension of traditional
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). It enhances traditional RBAC by
incorporating the notion of object roles and environment roles, with the
traditional notion of subject roles. These new types of roles allow one to
define rich, easy-to-understand security policies without having significant
technical knowledge of the underlying computer systems that implement those
policies. In this paper, we motivate the need for GRBAC, provide a
high-level description of it and demonstrate its usefulness and flexibility
via several example applications.},

Our main contributions are (i) to derive a logic that precisely captures the intentions of the standard, (ii) to formally define a semantics for the XACML 3.0 component evaluation, and (iii) to define a semantics for the XACML 3.0 standard combining operators. To guard against modeling artefacts we provide an alternative lattice based way of characterizing the policy combining operators and we formally prove the equivalence of these approaches thereby increasing our faith in either one. We then discuss several ways of extending XACML: one direction is to extend XACML with new combining operators, and another direction is to incorporate the notion of conflict into XACML. We conclude by discussing the possibility of analysing XACML policies for gaps and conflicts.},

Our basic premise is that there is always inherent uncertainty and risk in access control decisions that is best addressed in an explicit way. We illustrate this concept by showing how the rationale of the well-known, Bell-Lapadula model based, multi-level security (MLS) access control model could be used to develop a risk-adaptive access control model. This new model is more like a fuzzy logic control system than a traditional access control system and hence the name "fuzzy MLS".

In this paper, we present a formal modeling and assessment of the security of mobile applications. In particular, we propose a security framework for verifying and enforcing BYOD security policies on Android devices. Interestingly, our approach is non-invasive and only requires minor platform modifications at application level. Finally, we provide empirical evidence of the practical feasibility of the approach by means of a prototype which we used to validate a set of real Android applications.},

These systems expose previously unavailable phone and network resources to application developers. However, with increased exposure comes increased risk. Poorly or maliciously designed applications can compromise the phone and network. While Android defines a base set of permissions to protect phone resources and core applications, it does not define what a secure phone is, relying on the applications to act together securely. In this paper, we develop the Kirin security framework to enforce policy that transcends applications, called policy invariants, and provides an “at installation ” self-certification process to ensure only policy compliant applications will be installed. We begin by describing the Google Android security model and formally model its existing policy. Using relatively simple policy invariants describing realistic security requirements, Kirin identified insecure policy configurations within Android leading to vulnerabilities in core phone services, thereby motivating additional security framework defining system-wide policy.},

Hence there is benefit in any framework for policy composition that is intuitive, formal (and so “analyzable” and “implementable”), expressive, independent of specific application domains, and yet able to be extended to create domain-specific instances. Here we develop such a framework based on Belnap logic. An access-control policy is interpreted as a four-valued predicate that maps access requests to either grant, deny, conflict, or unspecified -- the four values of the Belnap bilattice. We define an expressive access-control policy language PBel, having composition operators based on the operators of Belnap logic. Natural orderings on policies are obtained by lifting the truth and information orderings of the Belnap bilattice. These orderings lead to a query language in which policy analyses, for example, conflict freedom, can be specified. Policy analysis is supported through a reduction of the validity of policy queries to the validity of propositional formulas on predicates over access requests. We evaluate our approach through firewall policy and RBAC policy examples, and discuss domain-specific and generic extensions of our policy language.},

We present Cassandra, a language and system for expressing policy, and the results of a substantial case study, a security policy for a national electronic health record system, based on the requirements for the ongoing UK National Health Service procurement exercise. Cassandra policies are expressed in a language based on Datalog with constraints. The expressiveness of the language (and its computational complexity) can be tuned by choosing an appropriate constraint domain. Cassandra is role-based; it supports credential-based access control (e.g. between administrative domains); and rules can refer to remote policies (for automatic credential retrieval and trust negotiation). Moreover, the policy language is small, and it has a formal semantics for query evaluation and for the access control engine. For the case study we choose a constraint domain C0 that is sufficiently expressive to encode many policy idioms. The case study turns out to require many subtle variants of these; it is important to express this variety smoothly, rather than add them as ad hoc features. By ensuring only a constraint compact fragment of C0 is used, we guarantee a finite and computable fixed-point model. We use a top-down evaluation algorithm, for efficiency and to guarantee termination. The case study (with some 310 rules and 58 roles) demonstrates that this language is expressive enough for a real-world application; preliminary results suggest that the performance should be acceptable.},

	abstract = {Most of the research work for enforcing security policies on smartphones considered coarse-grained policies, e.g. either to allow an application to run or not. In this paper we present CRePE, the first system that is able to enforce fine-grained policies, e.g. that vary while an application is running, that also depend on the context of the smartphone. A context can be defined by the status of some variables (e.g. location, time, temperature, noise, and light), the presence of other devices, a particular interaction between the user and the smartphone, or a combination of these. CRePE allows context-related policies to be defined either by the user or by trusted third parties. Depending on the authorization, third parties can set a policy on a smartphone at any moment or just when the phone is within a particular context, e.g. within a building, or a plane.},
